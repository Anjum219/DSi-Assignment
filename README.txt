## MY DESIGNING APPROACH

Vehicle showroom is an application where there is a showroom of different sorts of vehicles e.g., normal, sports, heavy vehicles. They have different properties like model number, tire size, engine type, weight etc. There are options to create, remove and view vehicles.

I followed the ##Factory## design pattern where __vehicle__ is the interface implemented by the different types of vehicles.
